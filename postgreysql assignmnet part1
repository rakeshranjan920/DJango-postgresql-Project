Q.2 --- PostgreySql Drop trigger :---
ans ----   

DROP TRIGGER -- remove a trigger 

DROP TRIGGER [ IF EXISTS ] name ON table [ CASCADE | RESTRICT ]


DROP TRIGGER removes an existing trigger definition. To execute this command, the current user must be the owner of the table for which the trigger is defined.

IF EXISTS
Do not throw an error if the trigger does not exist. A notice is issued in this case.

name
The name of the trigger to remove.

table
The name (optionally schema-qualified) of the table for which the trigger is defined.

CASCADE
Automatically drop objects that depend on the trigger.

RESTRICT
Refuse to drop the trigger if any objects depend on it. This is the default. 

example --

Destroy the trigger if_dist_exists on the table films: 
DROP TRIGGER if_dist_exists ON films;

compatiability --
The DROP TRIGGER statement in PostgreSQL is incompatible with the SQL standard. In the SQL standard, trigger names are not local to tables, so the command is simply DROP TRIGGER name
